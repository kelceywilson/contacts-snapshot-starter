Authorization
Only a user with an admin role should be able to create a new contact. If the logged in user is not an admin, going to the route /contacts/new should return a status code 403.
Only a user with an admin role should be able to delete a contact. If the logged in user is not an admin, going to the route /contacts/delete/:contactId should return a status code 403. The delete links on the page should not be shown if the logged in user is not an admin.

Stretch Specs
If you use express-session, use a persistent session store https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-pg-simple to store the sessions (instead of the default in memory store that express-session uses)
A user should be able to have more than one role. For example, a user can have roles reporter, and editor, which would give them access to the resources that are available to both those roles.
